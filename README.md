# InvertMouse
Adds the ability to invert the mouse Y-axis in games that lack this feature, such as Genshin Impact

# Usage

1. Install [Interception](https://github.com/oblitum/Interception) driver. Reboot.
2. Run [InvertMouse](https://github.com/oleg-st/InvertMouse/releases/latest)

# Requirements
[Interception](https://github.com/oblitum/Interception) driver installed. .NET Framework 4+

# How it works

InvertMouse uses `Interception` driver and library to invert mouse Y-axis when cursor is hidden. 
This allows interactions in the menu (when cursor is visible) without inverted Y-axis.
